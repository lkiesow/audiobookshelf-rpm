# Audiobookshelf RPM Repository

This repository provides RPM packages for [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/).
Supported operating systems are all Red Hat and CentOS Stream 8/9/10 variants like:

- RHEL
- CentOS Stream
- Rocky Linux
- AlmaLinux

## Installation

To activate the repository, run:

```
dnf install -y "https://github.com/lkiesow/audiobookshelf-rpm/raw/el$(rpm -E %rhel)/audiobookshelf-repository-1-1.el$(rpm -E %rhel).noarch.rpm"
```

You can now install Audiobookshelf.
All dependencies will be installed automatically:

```
dnf install audiobookshelf
```


## Configuration

You can configure Audiobookshelf in `/etc/default/audiobookshelf`.
Here you can add the same configuration options you would pass to the Docker container.

```properties
METADATA_PATH=/var/lib/audiobookshelf/metadata
CONFIG_PATH=/var/lib/audiobookshelf/config
PORT=13378
HOST=127.0.0.1
```

For security reasons, the default configuration will listen to `localhost` only.
This should be sufficient if you install a reverse proxy (you should!).
If you want to listen to all network interfaces, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` instead.


## Start Audiobookshelf

To run Audiobookshelf and ensure it will be started automatically after a reboot, run:

```
systemctl start audiobookshelf.service
systemctl enable audiobookshelf.service
```

To check the current status of the service, run:

```
systemctl status audiobookshelf.service
```
